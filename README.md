# The Barbershop Final Project Backend

### Framework and libraries  
1. Spring, Spring Boot  
2. h2 database
3. Jpa Repository  


### Short Description
The program is a server that  
1. Creates database (see folder ```entities```)
2. Fills database in start (see ```resources/data.sql```)
3. Creates controllers that process requests from the client side and get/update the data on database  

You can see current database by [link](http://localhost:8080/h2-console). The login is ```user``` and password is ```user``` too. There you can 
find all tables and data, to see how frontend sends updating.
